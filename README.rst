=============================
mixedvines Package for Python
=============================

Package for canonical vine copula trees with mixed continuous and discrete
marginals.  If you use this software for publication, please cite [1].


Description
-----------

This packge contains a complete framework based on canonical vine copulas for
modelling multivariate data that are partly discrete and partly continuous.
The resulting multivariate distributions are flexible with rich dependence
structures and arbitrary marginals.  Please see [1] for a more detailed
description of the framework.
